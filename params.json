If you have, you may have noticed the page is hard to read on mobile devices.  Also, not all job results are relevant--searching for _mathematician_ for example returns jobs like _waiter_ or _bartender_.  \r\n\r\nHence, I made this web app for searching for US federal government jobs.  It is cross platform and mobile friendly, and it uses machine learning to sort jobs from most to least interesting. You can try it [here](http://mgalbright.github.io/usajobtool/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/mgalbright/usajobtool).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
