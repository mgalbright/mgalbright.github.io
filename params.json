{"name":"mgalbright.github.io","tagline":"","body":"# Usajobs Search Tool\r\n\r\nHave you ever looked for jobs on [usajobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov)?  If you have, you may have noticed that the page is hard to read on mobile devices.  Also, not all job results are relevant--for example, searching for _mathematician_ often returns jobs like _waiter_ or _bartender_.  \r\n\r\nHence, I made a web app for searching for US federal government jobs.  It is cross platform and mobile friendly, and it uses machine learning to sort jobs from most to least interesting. You can try it [here](http://mgalbright.github.io/usajobtool/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/mgalbright/usajobtool).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
